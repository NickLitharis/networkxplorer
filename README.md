### Network Analysis with Pandas, NetworkX, and Matplotlib

This repository provides code and examples for performing network analysis using the Pandas, NetworkX, and Matplotlib libraries in Python. The code demonstrates various tasks such as reading data, creating graphs, calculating network metrics, and visualizing networks. 


## Prerequisites

To run the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Pandas library
- NetworkX library
- Matplotlib library


## Network Analysis with Ego Network

This snippet focuses on analyzing an ego network. It reads data from a CSV file and creates a graph using NetworkX. It then calculates various network metrics such as the number of nodes, number of edges, mean degree, characteristic path length, and mean clustering coefficient. Finally, it visualizes the network using Matplotlib.

## Network Analysis with User Friends

This snippet demonstrates network analysis based on user friendships. It reads data from a CSV file containing user friendships and constructs a graph using NetworkX. It calculates network metrics including the number of nodes, number of edges, whether all users are connected, mean degree, characteristic path length, and mean clustering coefficient. Additionally, it generates a bar plot to visualize the frequency distribution of user scores using Matplotlib.
